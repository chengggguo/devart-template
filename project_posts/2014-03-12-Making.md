We are very interested in the concept of seeing, the relationship between people who are looking and objects that are being looked at. Somehow, the object could react to the line of sight. It may stares back, feels anxious, turns on, etc, creats tension to attension.

So we hope the installation will 'notice' itself being watched, the more people are gathering, the more excited it will be, the tighter clockspring role and finally hit the soap surface.
