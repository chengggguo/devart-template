Now is the 3D modelling!

Sensor holder as well as the hanging part with 6 infrared sensor switches. It quite looks like an submarineï¼Œwe think it gona be in Silver in the end.

Stepmotor holder. a little support which is designed as silm as possible. hope it will be strong enough!

Propeller and clockspring holder. this small holder has various size shallow holes for bearings and clockspring holder.

I will send them to 3D prints soon
